- Better handles packet loss than OBS (Such as guests on poor Wi-Fi connections)
- Using OBS to Window Capture the Electron Capture App window has lower resource usage than using the browser source directly in OBS
- Able to capture the Electron Capture window in multiple instances of OBS without forcing your players' computers to output 2 different video streams (one for each OBS instance)
- It's frame-less so no need to crop after a window-capture
- It's a stable version and it won't auto-update on you to something unstable.
- It can be launched via command line to open to a specific link
- It lets you select exact window sizes (1280x720, etc), so pixel sizes are captured 1:1 exactly
- It is more stable than OBS ; no video corruption caused by packet loss
- Doesn't have a timestamp sync bug that is in OBS browser source
- Doesn't throttle performance if backgrounded like Chrome does
- There is an always on top option, allowing for screen-capping
- Auto-detects and changes to the correct window size if high DPi mode is on
- It loads up to a nice homepage with audio-output options and other selectable options
- I guess no google tracking?
- Some of the experimental builds have improved encoding peformance; max quality
- Sharing a video as a screen-share into Zoom provides higher quality video versus a virtual camera input into Zoom. Helpful if you want to use OBS.Ninja to turn your iPhone into a remote webcam for Zoom Meetings maybe.
